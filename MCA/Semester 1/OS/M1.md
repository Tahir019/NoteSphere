## **1. Introduction to Operating System**  
### **Definition**  
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an **interface between the user and the hardware**. It **manages resources** like CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices.  

### **Key Functions of OS**  
- **Process Management** â€“ Handles running applications (processes).  
- **Memory Management** â€“ Allocates and manages RAM usage.  
- **File System Management** â€“ Organizes data storage.  
- **Device Management** â€“ Controls hardware devices.  
- **User Interface** â€“ Provides CLI or GUI interaction.

## **2. OS and the Computer System**  
### **How OS Works in a Computer System?**  
1. **User** interacts with the **application software**.  
2. Application software sends **requests to the OS**.  
3. OS **manages hardware** (CPU, memory, storage) to complete the task.  

### **Types of Interfaces**  
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)** â€“ Uses text-based commands (e.g., Linux Shell, Windows CMD).  
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** â€“ Uses visuals like windows, buttons (e.g., Windows, macOS).

## **3. Classes of Operating Systems**  
### **1. Batch Operating System**  
- Executes **a set of jobs in batches** without user interaction.  
- Used in early computers (e.g., punch cards).  
- **Example:** IBM Mainframes.  

### **2. Time-Sharing Operating System**  
- Uses **CPU scheduling** to provide **quick switching** between multiple users.  
- **Example:** Unix, Linux, Windows.  

### **3. Distributed Operating System**  
- Runs on **multiple connected computers** that share resources.  
- **Example:** Google Cloud, Hadoop.  

### **4. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**  
- Processes tasks with **strict timing constraints**.  
- Used in **aircraft, medical devices, robotics**.  
- **Example:** VxWorks, QNX.  

### **5. Multiprocessing & Multithreading OS**  
- **Multiprocessing:** Uses multiple CPUs.  
- **Multithreading:** Runs multiple threads within a process.  
- **Example:** Windows, Linux.

## **4. Processes and Programs**  
### **Definition of Process**  
A **process** is an **instance of a running program** that includes code, data, and system resources.  

### **Process States**  
1. **New** â€“ Created but not running.  
2. **Ready** â€“ Waiting for CPU allocation.  
3. **Running** â€“ Executing on the CPU.  
4. **Waiting** â€“ Blocked, waiting for input/output.  
5. **Terminated** â€“ Completed execution.  

---

## **5. Threads**  
A **thread** is the **smallest unit of execution** within a process.  

### **Types of Threads**  
- **User Threads** â€“ Managed by user applications.  
- **Kernel Threads** â€“ Managed by the OS.  

### **Advantages of Threads**  
- Faster than processes.  
- Efficient CPU usage.  
- Improves responsiveness in applications.

## **6. CPU Scheduling Policies**  
CPU scheduling selects which process runs next.  

### **Non-Preemptive Scheduling Policies**  
1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** â€“ Processes execute in arrival order.  
2. **Shortest Job Next (SJN)** â€“ The shortest process executes first.  

### **Preemptive Scheduling Policies**  
1. **Round Robin (RR)** â€“ Each process gets a fixed CPU time (time quantum).  
2. **Priority Scheduling** â€“ Processes run based on priority.  
3. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** â€“ The process with the shortest remaining execution time runs next.  

### **Real-Time Scheduling**  
- **Hard Real-Time:** Must meet strict deadlines.  
- **Soft Real-Time:** Meeting deadlines is preferred but not mandatory.

## **7. Scheduling in Unix, Linux, and Windows**  
### **Unix Scheduling**  
- Uses **multi-level feedback queues**.  
- Supports **round-robin and priority scheduling**.  

### **Linux Scheduling**  
- Uses **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)** for fair execution.  
- Supports real-time scheduling.  

### **Windows Scheduling**  
- Uses **priority-based scheduling**.  
- Divides processes into foreground and background tasks.

## **8. Basic Commands of Linux Shell**  
A **Linux Shell** allows users to interact with the OS using commands.  

### **Important Commands**  
| **Command** | **Description** |  
|------------|--------------|  
| `pwd` | Prints the current directory path. |  
| `cd <directory>` | Changes to the specified directory. |  
| `mkdir <directory>` | Creates a new directory. |  
| `rmdir <directory>` | Removes an empty directory. |  
| `ls` | Lists files in the current directory. |  

### **Examples**  
```bash
pwd               # Show current directory path
cd Documents      # Move to the 'Documents' directory
mkdir Projects    # Create a new directory named 'Projects'
rmdir OldFolder   # Remove an empty directory
ls -l            # List files with details
```
