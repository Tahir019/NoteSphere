## **1. Memory Management Overview**  
### **Definition**  
Memory management is the process of **allocating, tracking, and optimizing memory usage** in an operating system. It ensures:  
- Efficient utilization of RAM.  
- Avoidance of memory leaks.  
- Fast access to memory for programs.  

### **Key Functions of Memory Management**  
- **Memory Allocation & Deallocation** â€“ Assigning and freeing memory for processes.  
- **Memory Protection** â€“ Preventing unauthorized access.  
- **Address Mapping** â€“ Converting logical addresses to physical addresses.  
- **Paging & Segmentation** â€“ Dividing memory into manageable sections.

## **2. Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation**  
### **1. Static Memory Allocation**  
- Memory is **allocated at compile time**.  
- **Fixed size**, cannot be changed during execution.  
- **Faster execution** but inefficient memory usage.  
- **Example:** Global and static variables in C.  

```c
int a[10]; // Memory allocated at compile time
```

### **2. Dynamic Memory Allocation**  
- Memory is **allocated at runtime**.  
- More **flexible**, can increase or decrease memory size.  
- **Example:** Using `malloc()`, `calloc()` in C.  

```c
int *ptr = (int*) malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); // Allocating memory dynamically
```

---

## **3. Contiguous and Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation**  
### **1. Contiguous Memory Allocation**  
- **Processes are stored in consecutive memory blocks.**  
- **Simple but leads to fragmentation.**  
- Uses **Fixed Partitioning** or **Variable Partitioning**.  

### **2. Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation**  
- **Processes are divided into smaller chunks and stored in different locations.**  
- Uses **Paging and Segmentation** techniques.  
- **Eliminates external fragmentation.**

## **4. Paging**  
### **Definition**  
Paging is a **non-contiguous memory management technique** where the process is divided into **fixed-size pages** and stored in **frames** of the same size in memory.  

### **How Paging Works?**  
1. **Logical Address (Pages) â†’ Physical Address (Frames).**  
2. OS maintains a **Page Table** to map pages to frames.  
3. No external fragmentation but **internal fragmentation** may occur.  

### **Example**  
| **Page Number** | **Frame Number** |  
|---------------|--------------|  
| 0 | 3 |  
| 1 | 1 |  
| 2 | 4 |  
| 3 | 2 |

## **5. Segmentation**  
### **Definition**  
Segmentation divides memory into **variable-sized logical segments** (Code, Stack, Data). Each segment has a **base address and limit**.  

### **How Segmentation Works?**  
- **Segment Table** maps segment numbers to memory locations.  
- No **internal fragmentation**, but **external fragmentation** may occur.  

### **Example**  
| **Segment** | **Base Address** | **Limit** |  
|-----------|--------------|------|  
| Code | 1000 | 400 |  
| Data | 2000 | 500 |  
| Stack | 3000 | 200 |

## **6. Relocation and Linking**  
### **1. Relocation**  
- Converts logical addresses to physical addresses.  
- **Static Relocation** â€“ Done at compile time.  
- **Dynamic Relocation** â€“ Done during execution.  

### **2. Linking**  
- Combines multiple object files into a single executable.  
- **Static Linking** â€“ Linking happens at compile time.  
- **Dynamic Linking** â€“ Linking happens at runtime.

## **7. Virtual Memory**  
### **Definition**  
Virtual memory allows a system to **use disk space as RAM** when physical memory is full.  

### **Advantages**  
- Run large applications with limited RAM.  
- Increases multitasking efficiency.  
- Uses **paging and segmentation** to manage memory.  

---

### **7.1 Demand Paging**  
Instead of loading the entire process into memory, **only required pages are loaded on demand**.  

### **Steps in Demand Paging**  
1. If a required page is in memory, use it.  
2. If not, a **page fault** occurs.  
3. The missing page is loaded from disk to memory.  

---

### **7.2 Page Replacement Policies**  
When memory is full, the OS replaces old pages with new ones using **replacement algorithms**.  

#### **1. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
- Oldest page is replaced first.  
- **Simple but inefficient**.  

#### **2. LRU (Least Recently Used)**
- Replaces the **least recently used** page.  
- **More efficient** but needs extra hardware.  

#### **3. Optimal Page Replacement**
- Replaces the page that will not be needed for the longest time.  
- **Best performance but requires future knowledge**.  

---

### **7.3 Shared Pages**  
- Allows multiple processes to **share the same memory pages**.  
- Reduces redundancy and improves efficiency.  
- **Example:** Shared libraries in Linux.  

---

### **7.4 Segmentation in Virtual Memory**  
- Combines **segmentation and paging** for better memory utilization.  
- **Segments are divided into pages** to avoid external fragmentation.
