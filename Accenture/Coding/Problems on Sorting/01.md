# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Problem Statement

Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Bubble Sorting algorithm.

### Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** 
     - `N = 6`
     - `array[] = {13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9}`
   - **Output:** 
     - `9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52`
   - **Explanation:** After sorting we get `9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** 
     - `N = 5`
     - `array[] = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`
   - **Output:** 
     - `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
   - **Explanation:** After sorting we get `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

## Solution

### Approach

The algorithm steps are as follows:

1. Select the range of the unsorted array by running an outer loop (say `i`) that signifies the last index of the selected range, running backward from `n-1` to `0` (where `n` is the size of the array).
   - `i = n-1` means the range is from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `i = n-2` means the range is from `0` to `n-2`, and so on.

2. Within the outer loop, run another inner loop (say `j`) from `0` to `i-1` to push the maximum element to the last index of the selected range by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements.
   - Swap adjacent elements if `arr[j] > arr[j+1]` until the maximum element reaches the end of the current range.

3. After each iteration of the outer loop, the last part of the array will become sorted.
   - After `(n-1)` iterations, the whole array will be sorted.

### Dry Run

- **Iteration 1:** [Complete the dry run as per your understanding or teaching requirement]
- **Iteration 2:** [Complete the dry run as per your understanding or teaching requirement]
- **Iteration 3:** [Complete the dry run as per your understanding or teaching requirement]
- **Iteration 4:** [Complete the dry run as per your understanding or teaching requirement]
- **Iteration 5:** [Complete the dry run as per your understanding or teaching requirement]

## Code Implementation

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void bubble_sort(int arr[], int n) {
    // Bubble sort implementation
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << "After Using Bubble Sort: " << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    
    cout << "Before Using Bubble Sort: " << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    bubble_sort(arr, n);
    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
Before Using Bubble Sort:
13 46 24 52 20 9
After Using Bubble Sort:
9 13 20 24 46 52
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N²), where `N` is the size of the array, for the worst and average cases.
  - The outer loop runs `n` times, and for each `i`, the inner loop runs from `0` to `i-1`, resulting in approximately `(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1` steps, which sums to O(N²).

- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

---

## Optimized Approach (Reducing Time Complexity for Best Case)

The best case occurs if the given array is already sorted. We can reduce the time complexity to O(N) by adding a check inside the loops.

### Optimized Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void bubble_sort(int arr[], int n) {
    // Bubble sort implementation with optimization
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int didSwap = 0; // Check if a swap occurred
        for (int j = 0; j <= i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap elements
                int temp = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
                didSwap = 1; // A swap occurred
            }
        }
        // If no swap occurred, array is sorted
        if (didSwap == 0) {
            break;
        }
    }

    cout << "After Using Optimized Bubble Sort: " << "\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
}
```

## Conclusion

Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that can be optimized to run faster in certain cases. Understanding its mechanism helps in grasping more advanced sorting algorithms.
