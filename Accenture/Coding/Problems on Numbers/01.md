# Check if a Number is Palindrome

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `N`, return `true` if it is a palindrome; otherwise, return `false`.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121, 1331, and 4554 are palindromes because they remain the same when their digits are reversed.

### Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** `N = 4554`
   - **Output:** `Palindrome Number`
   - **Explanation:** The reverse of `4554` is `4554`, and therefore it is a palindrome.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** `N = 7789`
   - **Output:** `Not Palindrome`
   - **Explanation:** The reverse of `7789` is `9877`, and therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Optimal Approach

### Algorithm / Intuition

To check if a number is a palindrome, we can extract the digits of the number to create a reversed number. We then compare the reversed number with the original number.

### Steps

1. **Initialize** an integer `revNum` to `0`. This variable will store the reverse of the number.
2. **Create a duplicate** of the original number and store it in an integer `dup` for later comparison.
3. **Run a while loop** with the condition `n > 0` to reverse the number:
   - Get the last digit of `n` using the modulus operator `%` with `10` and store it in a temporary variable `ld`.
   - Update `revNum` by multiplying it by `10` and adding the last digit `ld`.
   - Update `n` by integer division with `10` to remove the last digit.
4. **After the loop**, check if the original number `dup` is equal to the reversed number `revNum`.
   - If they are equal, return `true` indicating the number is a palindrome.
   - If they are not equal, return `false` indicating that the number is not a palindrome.

### Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if a given integer is a palindrome
bool palindrome(int n) {
    // Initialize a variable to store the reverse of the number
    int revNum = 0;
    // Create a duplicate variable to store the original number
    int dup = n;

    // Iterate through each digit of the number until it becomes 0
    while (n > 0) {
        // Extract the last digit of the number
        int ld = n % 10;
        // Build the reverse number by appending the last digit
        revNum = (revNum * 10) + ld;
        // Remove the last digit from the original number
        n = n / 10;
    }

    // Check if the original number is equal to its reverse
    return dup == revNum; // Return true if equal, false otherwise
}

int main() {
    int number = 4554;

    if (palindrome(number)) {
        cout << number << " is a palindrome." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << number << " is not a palindrome." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
4554 is a palindrome.
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(log10 N) where `N` is the input number. The time complexity is determined by the number of digits in the input integer `N`. In the worst case when `N` is a multiple of `10`, the number of digits in `N` is log10 N + 1. The while loop divides `N` by `10` until it becomes `0`, which takes log10 N iterations. In each iteration, constant time operations like modulus and division are performed.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as only a constant amount of additional memory is used for the reversed number, regardless of the size of the input number.

## Conclusion

The approach provided effectively checks if a number is a palindrome by reversing the number and comparing it with the original. Understanding this method will strengthen your command of similar problems in programming.
