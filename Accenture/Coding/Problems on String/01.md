### Problem Statement
Given a string, check if it is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Examples
- **Example 1:**
  - **Input:** `Str = "ABCDCBA"`
  - **Output:** Palindrome
  - **Explanation:** The string when reversed is the same as the original string.
  
- **Example 2:**
  - **Input:** `Str = "TAKE U FORWARD"`
  - **Output:** Not Palindrome
  - **Explanation:** The string when reversed is not the same as the original string.

### Approach

1. **Iterative Method:**
   - Initialize two pointers: `left` starting from the beginning of the string and `right` from the end.
   - Use a loop to compare characters at these pointers while moving towards the center.
   - If any characters do not match, return false.
   - If all character comparisons succeed, return true.

2. **Recursive Method:**
   - Create a helper function that compares characters at the two ends of the string.
   - If the characters are the same, call the function recursively for the next set of characters.
   - If they differ, return false.
   - Return true if the base condition is met (i.e., all characters matched).

### Code Implementations

#### Iterative Approach

**C++:**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool isPalindrome(string s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        // Ignore non-alphanumeric characters
        if (!isalnum(s[left])) 
            left++;
        else if (!isalnum(s[right])) 
            right--;
        else if (tolower(s[left]) != tolower(s[right])) 
            return false;
        else {
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    string str = "ABCDCBA";
    bool ans = isPalindrome(str);
    
    if (ans) {
        cout << "Palindrome";
    } else {
        cout << "Not Palindrome";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Iterative Approach:** O(N), where N is the length of the string.
- **Recursive Approach:** O(N) in the average case as well, since each character is compared once.

### Space Complexity
- **Iterative Approach:** O(1) since no extra space is used other than pointers.
- **Recursive Approach:** O(N) due to the call stack used for recursion.

### Summary
Both approaches effectively check for palindromes, but the iterative method is generally preferred for its lower space complexity. The recursive method is elegant but may lead to stack overflow for very long strings due to deep recursion.
