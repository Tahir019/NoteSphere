# Convert Binary to Decimal

## Problem Statement

Convert a binary number to a decimal number.

### Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** `N = 1011`
   - **Output:** `11`
   - **Explanation:** `1011` when converted to decimal is `11`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** `N = 100`
   - **Output:** `4`
   - **Explanation:** `100` when converted to decimal is `4`.

## Solution

### Intuition

The idea is to add the appropriate power of `2` to the final answer whenever the bit is set.

### Approach

1. Take the input as a string.
2. Traverse from the rightmost character to the left.
3. Maintain an integer `base` and multiply it by `2` each time to store values of `pow(2, i)`.
4. Check if the character is `‘1’` or `‘0’`. If it is `‘1’`, add `base` to your final answer.

### Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s = "1011";
    int n = s.length();
    int base = 1;
    int ans = 0;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] == '1') {
            ans += base;
        }
        base *= 2;
    }
    
    cout << ans; // Output: 11
}
```

### Output

```
11
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where `N` is the length of the binary string since we are iterating over it with a single loop.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

---

## Alternative Solution: Using Predefined Functions

### C++

- **Syntax:** `stoi(string s, int position, int base)`
  
- **Approach:** Set `position` to `0` (starting position) and `base` to `2` (since the input is in binary).

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s = "1011";
    cout << stoi(s, 0, 2); // Output: 11
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity for Alternative Solution

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where `N` is the length of the binary string.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space.

## Conclusion

Both approaches provided effectively convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent. The manual method is a good exercise in understanding binary representation, while the predefined functions offer a quick and efficient solution.
