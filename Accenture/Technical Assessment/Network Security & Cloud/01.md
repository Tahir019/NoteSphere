# Accenture Network Security & Cloud Computing Questions

## Q1) You are working on a router that has established privilege levels that restrict access to certain functions. You discover that you are not able to execute the command `show running-configuration`. How can you view and confirm that the access list that has been applied to the Ethernet 0 interface on your router?
- **Options:**
  - A. `show access-lists`
  - B. `show interface Ethernet 0`
  - C. `show ip access-lists`
  - D. `show ip interface Ethernet 0`
  
- **Answer:** Option D

- **Explanation:**  
The command `show ip interface Ethernet 0` displays the status of the interface along with the access lists that are applied to it, allowing you to confirm the applied access control lists (ACLs) on that specific interface.

## Q2) What command will permit SMTP mail to only host 1.1.1.1?
- **Options:**
  - A. `access-list 10 permit smtp host 1.1.1.1`
  - B. `access-list 110 permit ip smtp host 1.1.1.1`
  - C. `access-list 10 permit tcp any host 1.1.1.1 eq smtp`
  - D. `access-list 110 permit tcp any host 1.1.1.1 eq smtp`

- **Answer:** Option D

- **Explanation:**  
The command `access-list 110 permit tcp any host 1.1.1.1 eq smtp` specifies that any TCP traffic destined for host 1.1.1.1 on the SMTP port (port 25) is permitted. It is crucial to note that access lists are processed in order and that the correct usage of the access-list number (in this case, 110 for extended ACL) is essential.

## Q3) You want to create a standard access list that denies the subnet of the following host: 172.16.50.172/20. Which of the following would you start your list with?
- **Options:**
  - A. `access-list 10 deny 172.16.48.0 255.255.240.0`
  - B. `access-list 10 deny 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255`
  - C. `access-list 10 deny 172.16.64.0 0.0.31.255`
  - D. `access-list 10 deny 172.16.48.0 0.0.15.255`

- **Answer:** Option D

- **Explanation:**  
The subnet mask 255.255.240.0 corresponds to a /20 subnet, which means the address range is from 172.16.48.0 to 172.16.63.255. Therefore, `access-list 10 deny 172.16.48.0 0.0.15.255` effectively denies the entire /20 subnet.
