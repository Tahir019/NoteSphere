## Passage Questions

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

Sticky, gooey, oftentimes orange, and homemade within the ears - earwax is considered a gross nuisance that people tend to frequently remove and clean from the body. Whether it’s by cotton swab, an ill-advised method, or by an otolaryngologist, people go to great lengths for unobstructed ear canals—but is removing earwax a good idea? Why does our body produce earwax in the first place if we just remove it in the end?

Earwax, also known as cerumen, is made from a mixture of long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, cholesterol, and the chemical compound squalene. It’s secreted by glands in the outer ear canal to block dust, bacteria, insects, and other outside agents from infiltrating the ear canal and damaging the skin in the outer ear and the sensitive inner ear. While it’s incredibly beneficial to the health of the ear, overproduction can cause earwax impaction, blocking sound waves from reaching the eardrum. Use of cotton swabs to clean excessive earwax can lead to further problems, pushing the wax farther into the inner ear canal rather than drawing it out. This can cause permanent damage to the eardrum and hearing abilities.

### Q11) Which of the following best fits the blank in the passage?

- A. Complex
- B. Toxic
- C. Dangerous
- D. Safe

**Answer:** Option C  
**Explanation:** The term *ill-advised* suggests something that can cause damage, making *dangerous* the most fitting choice.

**Answer:** Option B
